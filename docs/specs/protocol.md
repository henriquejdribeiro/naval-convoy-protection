# Convoy mission protocol

The authoritative specification of the 24-message protocol that drives one
full mission cycle. The webapp's *Transaction flow diagram* visualises this
document; the spec lives here. **If the visualisation and this document
disagree, this document wins.**

The protocol is described for the **L2-Bravo lane** (drone β, ship B as
primary relay, mission `EX-011`). The **L2-Alpha lane** (drone α, ship F,
mission `EX-010`) is structurally identical — wherever a step has a
*Parallel lane* note, the alpha-lane equivalent runs simultaneously with
its own substituted symbols (α / `H_α` / `π_α`).

## Actors

| Lifeline | Role | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| **D** | Commander ship — holds the commander key | L1 |
| **L1 cluster** | All 6 PoA validator Geth nodes (A, B, C, D, E, F) | L1 |
| **B** | Bravo-lane primary relay (one of the 6 ships) | L1 |
| **F** | Alpha-lane primary relay (one of the 6 ships) | L1 |
| **drone β** (off-chain client) | The single Bravo drone — only client of L2-B | drone-trust |
| **Madara β** | Starknet sequencer for L2-B | L2 |
| **Pathfinder** (β) | Starknet full-node + JSON-RPC for L2-B | L2 |
| **Orchestrator** (β) | Settlement orchestrator for L2-B | L2 |
| **SNOS** (β) | StarkNet OS — produces PIE traces from sealed blocks | L2 |
| **Stone** (β) | STARK prover — runs FRI over the PIE | L2 |
| **HVUs** (3) | Protected ships in the convoy interior | off-network |

**L1 contracts** (replicated state across all 6 Geth nodes):
- `Registry.sol` — mission specs + verdicts
- `Verifier.sol` — STARK proof FRI re-verification
- `CommandLog.sol` — advance command log

---

## Trust boundaries

Four boundary crossings. Every other call is intra-domain.

| # | Crossing | What gates it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **commander → L1** (step 1) | `secp256k1` ECDSA over the commander key + `onlyCommander` modifier |
| 2 | **L1 → L2** (step 4 dispatch) | TLS over the convoy radio link; relay key whitelisted on Madara |
| 3 | **drone → L2** (steps 5–6) | Stark-curve ECDSA via the OZ account contract on Madara; Cairo program enforces `SAFE_AREA` on the witness |
| 4 | **L2 → L1** (step 19 relay handoff) | The relay ship runs `cpu_air_verifier` + `stark_evm_adapter` locally, **off-chain**, before forwarding the fact to L1. Soundness rests on this off-chain verifier being correct (it's StarkWare's production verifier — same one used by the GPS Statement Verifier on Ethereum mainnet), not on the relay's honesty |
| 5 | **L1 → L2** (step 24 advance bridge) | TLS over radio; same channel as step 4, opposite direction |

---

## Encoding conventions

| Quantity | Type | Encoding | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage threshold | `uint16` | permille | `950` = ≥ 95.0 % cells |
| Detection threshold (`p_min`) | `uint16` | basis points | `7000` = `p_contact ≥ 0.7` |
| `p_contact` per cell | `uint16` | basis points | `0`–`10000` |
| Time window | `uint64` | seconds | `360` = 6 min |
| Cell index `(x, y)` | `uint16` × 2 | grid index | `(24, 17)` |
| Timestamp | `uint64` | unix seconds | `1700000010` |
| Mission id | `uint256` (L1) / `u128` (L2) | opaque | `EX-010` = 10, `EX-011` = 11 |
| Drone id | `uint256` (L1) / `felt252` (L2) | enum-like | `α` = 1, `β` = 2 |
| Sweep commitment hash `H_β` | `felt252` | `Poseidon(cells)` | — |
| Proof bytes `π_β` | `bytes` (L1) | Stone output | ~100–500 KB |

---

## Phase 1 — Mission deploy & L2 dispatch (steps 1–4)

### Step 1 — D writes the deploy tx

- **Self-action** on ship D
- **Endpoint signature**:
  ```solidity
  function deploy(MissionSpec spec)
      external
      onlyCommander
      returns (uint256 mission_id);
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `spec.area_hash` — `bytes32` Poseidon hash of polygon vertices
  - `spec.coverage_min` — `uint16` permille (`950` = ≥ 95 % cells)
  - `spec.p_min` — `uint16` basis points (`7000` = `p_contact ≥ 0.7`)
  - `spec.time_window` — `uint64` seconds (`360` = 6 min)
- **Authentication**: `secp256k1` ECDSA, signed by D with the **commander
  key** (separate keystore entry from the regular ship key). The
  `onlyCommander` modifier on `Registry.deploy` checks
  `msg.sender == storedCommander`.
- **Trust boundary**: commander → L1 (no crossing — same actor, same
  domain; the commander key is the gate)
- **What happens**: D submits the deploy tx onto its own Geth node. The
  tx names mission `EX-011` (Bravo lane) and includes the full `MissionSpec`.

### Step 2 — PoA fan-out + Registry stores + emits `MissionDeployed`

- **Message**: D → L1 cluster (all 5 other ships)
- **Endpoint signature**:
  ```
  Clique PoA peer broadcast
    → Registry state write
    → emit MissionDeployed(mission_id, drone_id, spec)
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `block N` — sealed PoA block including the deploy tx
  - `signer` — rotating among the 6 ship validators (EIP-225)
  - `state Δ` — Registry storage updated with `(mission_id → MissionSpec)`
  - `event MissionDeployed(uint256 indexed mission_id, uint256 indexed drone_id, MissionSpec spec)`
  - `drone_id` is **indexed** so off-chain subscribers (relay ships) can
    filter on it
- **Authentication**: `secp256k1` — block sealer signs the block header.
  Other validators verify against the pre-baked validator list in
  `genesis.json`.
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: The deploy tx propagates to all 6 ships via Clique
  PoA peer fan-out. As the same block executes on every Geth node,
  `Registry.sol` stores the spec and emits `MissionDeployed`. After this
  block, A, B, C, D, E, F all see the same Registry state and event log.

### Step 3 — Event filter dispatches mission to relay (B for β, F for α)

- **Self-action** on ship B (with ship F highlighted in parallel)
- **Endpoint signature** (off-chain):
  ```
  web3.eth.subscribe("logs", {
    address: Registry,
    topics: [MissionDeployed, mission_id, drone_id]
  })
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - B's subscription: `topic[0]=MissionDeployed`, `topic[2]=β` →
    B's `onMission(spec)` handler runs
  - F's subscription: `topic[0]=MissionDeployed`, `topic[2]=α` →
    F's `onMission(spec)` handler runs
  - A, C, D, E: no relay subscription — observe only
  - Extracted: `mission_id + drone_id + MissionSpec` passed to the matching
    handler
- **Authentication**: No cryptographic auth on the read path — Geth's
  event log is local to each node. **The relay assignment is enforced by
  which `drone_id` each ship's orchestrator subscribes to** (configured
  in `orchestrator.toml` at deployment, not on-chain).
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: The `emit` in step 2 fires every event subscription
  that matches. B is configured to listen for `drone_id == β` and F for
  `drone_id == α`; their orchestrator handlers run automatically. This
  is how the contract "tells" the relay ships they have a job to do —
  without any direct on-chain call to a specific ship. A, C, D, E have
  the same Registry state but no relay subscription, so nothing fires.

### Step 4 — Radio dispatch to L2 (B → L2-B, F → L2-A)

- **Message**: ship B → L2-B banner (parallel lane: ship F → L2-A banner)
- **Endpoint signature** (off-chain):
  ```
  POST /l2-{bravo|alpha}/admin/deploy_mission
  body: { spec, mission_id }   (over convoy radio link)
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `spec` — `MissionSpec` relayed verbatim
  - `mission_id` — `uint256` same mission id as on L1 (`EX-010` for α, `EX-011`
    for β)
  - Bravo lane: `B → L2-B` with `mission_id = EX-011`
  - Alpha lane: `F → L2-A` with `mission_id = EX-010`
- **Authentication**: TLS + relay-to-L2 mutual auth. Ship B's relay key
  is whitelisted on Madara β; ship F's on Madara α. **Each relay is the
  only off-chain dispatcher for its lane** (per `orchestrator.toml`).
- **Trust boundary**: **L1 → L2 (radio handoff) — TRUST CROSSING**
- **What happens**: Both relay ships dispatch in parallel. B forwards
  `EX-011` to L2-B over the convoy radio link; F forwards `EX-010` to
  L2-A. Drones α and β now have their respective mission specs.
- **Parallel lane**: F → L2-A (mission_id = `EX-010`)

---

## Phase 2 — Drone sweep + commitment + block sealing (steps 5–7)

### Step 5 — `submit_telemetry(...)` × N (drone-signed)

- **Self-action** on Madara β (with parallel on Madara α). Logically the
  drone is the caller; visually we treat the call as Madara processing
  it because the drone is the L2's only client.
- **Endpoint signature** (Cairo on L2):
  ```cairo
  fn submit_telemetry(
      mission_id: u128,
      cells: Array<TelemetryCell>
  ) external
  ```
- **`TelemetryCell`** struct:
  - `x: u16`, `y: u16` — cell index in the area grid
  - `p_contact: u16` — basis points (max-prob hit observed in this cell,
    `0`–`10000`)
  - `ts: u64` — unix seconds
- **Payload (per call)**:
  - `mission_id` — same `mission_id` the dispatch carried
  - `cells: Array<TelemetryCell>` — one tx per cell, dozens per sweep
- **Authentication**: **Stark-curve ECDSA**. Drone β signs each L2 tx
  hash with its private key (`keystore/bravo.json`). The OpenZeppelin
  account contract on Madara recovers the public key and verifies it
  against its stored hash before letting the tx execute.
- **Trust boundary**: **drone → L2 — TRUST CROSSING**. Note that the
  signature only proves the drone *signed* the data, not that the data
  is *real*. A compromised drone could sign fake-low `p_contact` values.
  The actual `SAFE_AREA` enforcement happens later, inside the Cairo
  proof program (step 14).
- **What happens**: As drone β sweeps the right corridor, it sends one
  `submit_telemetry` tx per cell. Madara queues these into block N.
- **Parallel lane**: drone α calls `submit_telemetry` on Madara α with
  its own swept cells.

### Step 6 — `submit_sweep_commitment(mission_id, H_β)`

- **Self-action** on Madara β (parallel on Madara α with `H_α`)
- **Endpoint signature** (Cairo on L2):
  ```cairo
  fn submit_sweep_commitment(
      mission_id: u128,
      h: felt252
  ) external
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `mission_id: u128`
  - `h: felt252` — `H_β = Poseidon(cells)` over all cells submitted in
    step 5
- **Authentication**: Stark-curve ECDSA — same signing path as
  `submit_telemetry`. **The Cairo contract recomputes Poseidon over the
  witness cells and reverts if `h ≠ Poseidon(cells)`.** The drone can't
  lie about the hash.
- **Trust boundary**: **drone → L2 — TRUST CROSSING**
- **What happens**: Drone β closes the sweep. After this call, the
  Cairo contract holds `H_β` in storage as the public commitment that
  will eventually land on L1 as part of the proof's public inputs.
- **Parallel lane**: drone α commits `H_α = Poseidon(α-cells)` on
  Madara α.

### Step 7 — Madara seals block N

- **Self-action** on Madara β (parallel on Madara α)
- **Endpoint signature**: internal — Madara sequencer block production
- **Payload**:
  - `block N` — sealed Starknet block (header + tx list)
  - `state diff` — includes the `H_β` storage write
- **Authentication**: Sequencer signs the block with its own Madara
  identity key. **No STARK is generated yet** — that happens in the
  orchestrator pipeline below.
- **Trust boundary**: L2 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: Madara β bundles the telemetry + commitment txs
  into block N, executes them, computes the state diff, seals.
- **Parallel lane**: Madara α seals its own block in parallel.

---

## Phase 3 — Indexing (step 8)

### Step 8 — Madara → Pathfinder feeder gateway sync

- **Message**: Madara β → Pathfinder β (parallel on alpha lane)
- **Endpoint signature** (HTTP):
  ```
  GET /feeder_gateway/get_block?blockNumber=N
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `block` — sealed Starknet block N
  - `state_diff` — storage updates
- **Authentication**: No cryptographic auth — internal HTTP between L2
  services on the same Docker network.
- **Trust boundary**: L2 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: Pathfinder pulls block N from Madara, indexes it,
  exposes via Starknet JSON-RPC.

---

## Phase 4 — Proof-generation pipeline (steps 9–18)

All steps in this phase run inside the L2 docker network. No trust
crossings; soundness comes from the cryptographic gates inside SNOS
(step 14, Cairo VM constraint system) and Stone (step 17, FRI). All
mirror on the alpha lane.

### Step 9 — Orchestrator → Pathfinder: `starknet_getBlockWithTxs(N)`

- **Endpoint**: JSON-RPC `starknet_getBlockWithTxs({"block_number": N})`
- **Payload**: `block_number: u64`
- **What happens**: Orchestrator notices a block with a sweep commitment
  and pulls it from Pathfinder.

### Step 10 — Pathfinder → Orchestrator: `block + state_diff`

- **Payload**: header + tx list, `state_diff`, class hashes (contracts
  touched, needed for SNOS replay)
- **What happens**: Pathfinder returns everything SNOS will need.

### Step 11 — Orchestrator → SNOS: request proof input

- **Endpoint**: `snos.generate_pie(block, state_diff, class_hashes)`
- **What happens**: Orchestrator hands the block to SNOS and asks for a
  Cairo program input (PIE).

### Step 12 — SNOS → Pathfinder: state + receipts queries

- **Endpoint**: JSON-RPC: `starknet_getStateUpdate`,
  `starknet_getTransactionReceipt`, `starknet_call`
- **What happens**: SNOS needs more than the block — it queries
  Pathfinder for full state context.

### Step 13 — Pathfinder → SNOS: state + receipts

- **Payload**:
  - `state_update` — storage proof at block N-1
  - `receipts` — tx receipts for replay validation
  - `class defs` — Sierra/CASM class definitions

### Step 14 — SNOS replay (Cairo VM) — assert `SAFE_AREA`

- **Self-action** on SNOS (parallel on SNOS-α)
- **Endpoint**: `cairo_run(starknet_os.cairo, input=block + state)`
- **Payload outputs**:
  - execution trace — every Cairo opcode executed
  - memory access log — reads/writes for FRI proof generation
  - **PIE** — Program-Independent Executable
- **Authentication**: **The cryptographic gate is the Cairo VM
  constraint system itself.** If any constraint fails (e.g. `SAFE_AREA`
  assertion), the replay aborts and no PIE is produced.
- **What happens**: SNOS replays block N inside lambdaclass `cairo-vm`.
  The `SAFE_AREA` assertion in `safe_area_verify.cairo` runs here. If
  any of `{coverage ≥ 95%, time ≤ 360s, all p_contact < 7000}` fails,
  the replay aborts. **No proof can be generated for invalid telemetry.**

### Step 15 — SNOS → Orchestrator: PIE

- **Payload**: PIE struct + public_input (`mission_id`, `H_β`,
  `area_hash`, thresholds)

### Step 16 — Orchestrator → Stone: `prove(PIE + config)`

- **Endpoint**:
  ```
  stone-prover-cli prove --pie <pie.zip> --config <prover.json>
  ```
- **Payload**: PIE from step 15 + prover params (field, blowup, FRI
  queries, security level)

### Step 17 — Stone runs FRI → π_β (parallel: π_α)

- **Self-action** on Stone (parallel on Stone-α)
- **Endpoint**: internal Stone prover
- **Payload outputs**:
  - AIR encoding — Algebraic Intermediate Representation of Cairo VM trace
  - FRI commit phase — Reed-Solomon commitments to the trace polynomial
  - FRI query phase — random sampling, Merkle decommitments → yields π_β
- **Authentication**: **The cryptographic gate IS the proof.** STARK
  soundness rests on collision-resistance of the hash and the FRI
  argument; no trusted setup.
- **What happens**: Stone produces the STARK proof bytes plus public
  inputs.

### Step 18 — Stone → Orchestrator: π_β + public inputs

- **Payload**:
  - `π_β` — proof bytes (~100–500 KB)
  - `public_input` — `mission_id`, `H_β`, `area_hash`, thresholds, `drone_id=β`

---

## Phase 5 — Relay back to L1 + on-chain verification (steps 19–21)

### Step 19 — Off-chain verify + Orchestrator hands fact to ship B (radio)

- **Message**: Orchestrator-β → ship B (parallel: Orchestrator-α → ship F)
- **Sub-actions inside the orchestrator** (run locally on the relay ship,
  before any L1 tx):
  1. `cpu_air_verifier` runs against π_β to confirm the STARK proof
     verifies (soundness gate — fails here if Stone produced an invalid
     proof).
  2. `stark_evm_adapter` converts the verified proof into the **fact**
     tuple expected by L1: `factHash = keccak256(programHash, outputHash)`.
  3. Public output values are extracted from the proof's public memory
     segment: `[n_cells, H_β, area_hash, coveragePermille, maxContactBp,
     elapsedSeconds]`.
- **Endpoint signature** (off-chain RPC):
  ```
  POST /relay/submit
  body: {
    programHash, outputHash, mission_id, drone_id,
    coveragePermille, maxContactBp, elapsedSeconds, H_bravo, n_steps
  }
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `programHash` — `bytes32` `keccak256` of the compiled `safe_area_verify.cairo` program bytecode
  - `outputHash` — `bytes32` `keccak256` of the ABI-encoded program output
  - `mission_id` — `uint256` mission id
  - `drone_id` — `uint256` α or β
  - Public output fields — `coveragePermille`, `maxContactBp`,
    `elapsedSeconds`, `H_β`, `n_steps`
- **Authentication**: **`cpu_air_verifier` is the cryptographic gate** —
  it runs StarkWare's production verifier locally and rejects any proof
  that doesn't pass FRI. Same verifier the GPS Statement Verifier uses
  on Ethereum mainnet. The relay ship's L1 tx envelope (next step) only
  authenticates the submitter; **the proof is already known to be valid
  by the time the fact reaches L1**.
- **Trust boundary**: **L2 → L1 (relay handoff) — TRUST CROSSING**.
  Soundness rests on `cpu_air_verifier` being correct (a well-audited
  StarkWare component). The relay ship is NOT trusted to vouch for
  proof validity — the fact registry pattern means "off-chain verify,
  on-chain register" rather than "on-chain re-verify".
- **What happens**: Orchestrator-β verifies π_β locally, runs the
  EVM-adapter to produce the fact, and hands the fact bundle to ship
  B's submission daemon. The proof bytes themselves do **not** travel
  to L1 (would be too expensive); only the 32-byte fact + public values.
- **Parallel lane**: Orchestrator-α → ship F with π_α's fact.

### Step 20 — `registerSafeProof(...)` tx (B for β-fact, F for α-fact)

- **Self-action** on ship B (parallel on ship F)
- **Endpoint signature** (Solidity on L1):
  ```solidity
  function registerSafeProof(
      bytes32 programHash,
      bytes32 outputHash,
      uint256 mission_id,
      uint256 drone_id,
      uint256 coveragePermille,
      uint256 maxContactBp,
      uint256 elapsedSeconds,
      bytes32 H_commitment,
      uint256 nSteps
  )
      external
      onlyRelay
      returns (uint256 proofId, bytes32 factHash);
  ```
- **Payload** (per call):
  - `programHash, outputHash` — fact components from step 19
  - `mission_id, drone_id` — same `mission_id` as deployed in step 1; `α` or `β`
  - `coveragePermille` — must satisfy `≥ MissionSpec.coverage_min`
  - `maxContactBp` — must satisfy `< MissionSpec.p_min`
  - `elapsedSeconds` — must satisfy `≤ MissionSpec.time_window`
  - `H_commitment` — Poseidon commitment over the cell array (recorded
    for audit; matches the on-chain `H_β` from `submit_sweep_commitment`)
  - `nSteps` — Cairo VM step count (provenance metadata)
- **Authentication**: **`secp256k1` ECDSA** — each relay signs its own
  L1 tx envelope. B signs the β-fact tx with its ship key, F signs the
  α-fact tx with its ship key. The `onlyRelay` modifier on
  `Verifier.registerSafeProof` checks `msg.sender` against the
  whitelisted relay-ship address for that `drone_id` (configured at
  deploy in `Verifier.sol`'s constructor).
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal (no crossing — the L2→L1 crossing
  was in step 19; from here on the fact is on the chain)
- **What happens**: In parallel, ship B writes its `registerSafeProof`
  tx for the β-fact onto its Geth node, and ship F writes its tx for
  the α-fact. Both call `Verifier.sol`.

### Step 21 — PoA fan-out → fact registered + verdict written + events

- **Message**: ship B → L1 cluster (parallel: ship F → L1 cluster)
- **Endpoint**: Clique PoA peer broadcast
- **Payload**:
  - `block N+k` — sealed PoA block including B's `registerSafeProof` tx
  - `block N+k+1` — sealed PoA block including F's `registerSafeProof` tx
    (may be the same block if same signer slot)
- **Authentication**: `secp256k1` — block sealer signs the header. Same
  PoA fan-out as step 2.
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: Both `registerSafeProof` txs propagate to all 6
  ships via Clique PoA. As each block executes on every Geth in lockstep,
  `Verifier.registerSafeProof`:
  1. Computes `factHash = keccak256(programHash, outputHash)`.
  2. Calls inherited `FactRegistry.registerFact(factHash)` — sets
     `verifiedFact[factHash] = true`.
  3. Stores the proof metadata (mission_id, drone_id, coverage/contact/elapsed
     fields, `H_commitment`, `nSteps`, `block.timestamp`,
     `block.number`) in the `proofs[]` array.
  4. Calls `Registry.setVerdict(mission_id, drone_id, SAFE)` (cross-contract,
     gated by `onlyVerifier` on Registry).
  5. Emits `FactRegistered(factHash, programHash, outputHash)` and
     `MissionVerified(proofId, mission_id, drone_id, factHash, coveragePermille,
     maxContactBp, elapsedSeconds)`.

  After this step, Registry holds `verdict[α] = SAFE` and
  `verdict[β] = SAFE` on every node, and the corresponding `factHash`es
  are marked verified. (Steps 1–5 above all happen as side-effects of
  the `registerSafeProof` tx execution; no separate steps in this
  protocol.)

---

## Phase 6 — Commander activates advance (steps 22–23)

### Step 22 — D sees dual-SAFE → `advance(MAX_SPEED)` tx

- **Self-action** on ship D
- **Endpoint signature** (Solidity on L1):
  ```solidity
  function advance(uint256 speed)
      external
      onlyCommander;
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `verdict_α: uint8` — `SAFE` (read from Registry by D's orchestrator)
  - `verdict_β: uint8` — `SAFE` (read from Registry by D's orchestrator)
  - `speed: uint256` — `MAX_SPEED` constant
- **Authentication**: **`secp256k1` ECDSA** — D signs the L1 tx with the
  **commander key** (separate keystore from the regular ship key). The
  `onlyCommander` modifier on `CommandLog.advance` checks
  `msg.sender == storedCommander`. **`CommandLog` also re-checks
  Registry to ensure dual-SAFE before accepting the call.**
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal
- **What happens**: Ship D's orchestrator polls Registry. Once it sees
  both α and β verdicts SAFE for the same mission, D signs an
  `advance(MAX_SPEED)` tx with the commander key and writes it to its
  Geth node. **This is the explicit go-ahead from the commander; the
  contract refuses the call if either verdict is missing.** (Pattern B —
  D triggers; verifier does NOT auto-fire. See `docs/decisions/`.)

### Step 23 — PoA fan-out → CommandLog stores + emits ConvoyAdvance

- **Message**: D → L1 cluster
- **Endpoint signature**:
  ```
  Clique PoA peer broadcast
    → CommandLog.advance executes
    → emit ConvoyAdvance(block_number, speed, commander)
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `block N+m` — sealed PoA block including D's advance tx
  - `state Δ` — `CommandLog` stores `(block_number, speed, commander)` record
  - `event ConvoyAdvance(uint256 indexed block_number, uint256 speed, address commander)`
- **Authentication**: `secp256k1` — block sealer signs the header. The
  advance tx itself was signed by D with the commander key.
  `CommandLog.advance` re-checks the `onlyCommander` modifier + dual-SAFE
  precondition before accepting.
- **Trust boundary**: L1 internal (no crossing)
- **What happens**: D's advance tx propagates to all 6 ships. As each
  Geth executes the tx, `CommandLog` stores the advance record and emits
  `ConvoyAdvance`. After this block, every ship's Geth has the same event
  log. (`CommandLog` storage write + event emission happen as
  side-effects of the advance tx execution; no separate steps.)

---

## Phase 7 — Radio bridge to drones (step 24)

### Step 24 — Radio advance to L2 drones (B → L2-B, F → L2-A)

- **Message**: ship B → L2-B banner (parallel: ship F → L2-A banner)
- **Endpoint signature** (off-chain):
  ```
  POST /l2-{bravo|alpha}/admin/advance
  body: { event: "ConvoyAdvance", block_number, speed }
  ```
- **Payload**:
  - `event: "ConvoyAdvance"`
  - `block_number: uint256` — L1 block where the advance was recorded
  - `speed: uint256` — `MAX_SPEED`
- **Authentication**: TLS + relay-to-L2 mutual auth (same channel as
  step 4, opposite direction). **No decision-making on B or F** — they
  are pure event-bridges (L1 event → radio frame). The decision was
  already made by D in step 22 and recorded on L1 in step 23.
- **Trust boundary**: **L1 → L2 (radio) — TRUST CROSSING**
- **What happens**: Final messages of the cycle. Both relays bridge the
  L1 advance event over radio to their L2 drones: B → L2-B (drone β),
  F → L2-A (drone α). A, C, D, E observe the same event in their L1
  event log but take no message-level action.

**Note on HVUs**: This protocol does NOT include a separate radio path
for HVUs. HVUs follow their escorts in formation; no separate command
channel is needed at the protocol level. (See `docs/decisions/`.)

## Mission lifecycle summary

| # | Phase | Sender | Receiver | Kind | Crossing | Brief |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | D | D | self | — | write `deploy(EX-011)` tx |
| 2 | 1 | D | L1 cluster | msg | — | PoA fan-out → Registry stores + emits `MissionDeployed` |
| 3 | 1 | B (also F) | self | self | — | event filter dispatches mission to relay |
| 4 | 1 | B (and F) | L2-B (and L2-A) | msg | ⚠ L1→L2 | radio dispatch of spec |
| 5 | 2 | drone β (and α) | Madara β (and α) | self | ⚠ drone→L2 | `submit_telemetry(...)` × N |
| 6 | 2 | drone β (and α) | Madara β (and α) | self | ⚠ drone→L2 | `submit_sweep_commitment(mission_id, H_β)` |
| 7 | 2 | Madara | Madara | self | — | seal block N |
| 8 | 3 | Madara | Pathfinder | msg | — | feeder gateway sync |
| 9 | 4 | Orch | Pathfinder | msg | — | `starknet_getBlockWithTxs(N)` |
| 10 | 4 | Pathfinder | Orch | msg | — | block + state_diff |
| 11 | 4 | Orch | SNOS | msg | — | request proof input |
| 12 | 4 | SNOS | Pathfinder | msg | — | state + receipts queries |
| 13 | 4 | Pathfinder | SNOS | msg | — | state + receipts |
| 14 | 4 | SNOS | SNOS | self | — | replay (Cairo VM) — assert `SAFE_AREA` |
| 15 | 4 | SNOS | Orch | msg | — | PIE |
| 16 | 4 | Orch | Stone | msg | — | send PIE + config |
| 17 | 4 | Stone | Stone | self | — | run FRI → π_β |
| 18 | 4 | Stone | Orch | msg | — | π_β + public inputs |
| 19 | 5 | Orch | ship B (and F) | msg | ⚠ L2→L1 | off-chain verify (`cpu_air_verifier`) → adapter → hand fact over radio |
| 20 | 5 | ship B (and F) | self | self | — | `registerSafeProof(...)` tx (fact + public outputs) |
| 21 | 5 | ship B (and F) | L1 cluster | msg | — | PoA fan-out → fact registered + verdict + `MissionVerified` event |
| 22 | 6 | D | D | self | — | `advance(MAX_SPEED)` tx |
| 23 | 6 | D | L1 cluster | msg | — | PoA fan-out → CommandLog + `ConvoyAdvance` |
| 24 | 7 | ship B (and F) | L2-B (and L2-A) | msg | ⚠ L1→L2 | radio advance to drones |

## Versioning

This document is the **v1** of the protocol. Changes require:
1. Updating this file
2. Bumping the version header below
3. Updating `tests/fixtures/mission-cases.json` if encoding or call shapes
   change
4. Re-running the Phase 3 mission-replay smoke test against the change
5. Recording the rationale in `docs/decisions/`

**Protocol version: 1.0**
**Last updated: when this file lands in main.**
